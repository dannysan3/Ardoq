# Task3

For task 3: Here are my findings.

I discovered that people spent more time cycling on Sundays than they did during the other days. There are many factors as to why this is the case. First of all, Sundays are known to be a more quiet day which means that more stores are closed. People also have their time off from work and the public transport travel at a lower rate. This means that people on Sundays have less access to stores and transport, which leaves them the only option to look for another alternatives for transport.
Another factor as to why the duration is the highest on Sundays, is due to the fact that people are more encouraged to do exercises or go on trips. This is because they usually dont have a large agenda on Sundays. This can for example mean taking a bike trip with friends or simply just exercise by using the bike.

My next findings was that the bikes were used for a shorter duration during the weekdays. This has to do with the opposite reasons as to why the bikes were mostly used on Sundays. Which is that people are back to work and they have more options when it comes to stores and public transportation. This results in the bikes being used for a short period of time because people might have other ways of transporting that they might find more convenient.
